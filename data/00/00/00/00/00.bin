我们在一家酒馆里

82
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,760
用酒馆当门面是我的主意
The pub facade was my idea.

83

我在你的传记里读到过  希望你喜欢

T'Why did you bring us here? What do you want with us?

88

都是好问题
All good questions.

89
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,230
把我送回去  赶紧的
Send me back. Now.

90
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,520
-又是你  -够了  来点新招行不行
- It's you again. - Come on. Get a new trick, man.

91
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,270
你们被选中
You have been chosen...

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
执行一个任务
for a mission that is both

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,920
该任务非常危险  并且绝对必要
highly dangerous and absolutely necessary

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,400
为了延续你们所知的生命
for the continuation of life as you know it.

95
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,720
起初  我搜遍永世  寻找一位真英雄
At first, I scoured eternity for one true hero.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
然后我看到了更大的格局
Then I saw the bigger picture.

97
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,640
这任务需要一支队伍
This mission requires a team.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,890
技能与经验的完美结合
The perfect combination of

99
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,070
光凭这就能获得成功
skills and experience that alone will triumph.

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
我先弄清楚
Let me get this straight.

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,260
你跑遍银河系把我们绑架到此  是为了什么
You kidnapped us from across the galaxy so we could, what?

102
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,870
让我们拯救宇宙吗
Save the universe?

103
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,010
不尽然
Not exactly.

104
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,610
比那要复杂一点
Bit more complicated than that.

105
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,790
你们不只是我们拯救一个宇宙的最大希望
You aren't just our best hope to save one universe.

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,090
你们是我们拯救所有宇宙的最后希望
You are my last hope to save all of them.

107
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,660
你们是多元宇宙守卫队
You are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

108
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,380
我知道这是怎么回事了  是洛基叫你耍我们的
I know what this is. Loki put you up to this joke.

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,530
听着  我今天没时间应付他的恶作剧
Listen, I do not have time for his pranks today.

110
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,970
我劝你别这么做
No, I wouldn't do that.

111
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,960
我的爱人简需要我  所以我要走了  你们玩得...
My lady Jane needs me. So, I'll be going. Enjoy yourse...

112
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,140
我们加入  能告诉我们要对付什么吗
We're in. Mind telling us what we're up against?

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,430
你们的世界不是正在正在  就是即将受到奥创攻击
Your worlds are either under attack or soon will be by Ultron,

114
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,080
他是升级为宇宙级存在的人工智能
an artificial intelligence elevated to a cosmic being

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,860
归因于强化了的人造身体
thanks to an enhanced synthetic body

116
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,990
及无限宝石的力量
and the power of the Infinity Stones.

117
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,630
六颗宝石  具有近乎深不可测的力量
Six stones of near unfathomable power.

118
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,710
每一颗都控制一种我们存在的基本方面
Each controlling an essential aspect of our existence.

119
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,070
奥创掌握了所有宝石
And Ultron holds all of them.

120
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,430
我也许能帮忙  我在更恶劣的条件下偷过更多东西
I might be able to help with that. I've stolen more from worse.

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,280
真的吗  你果然是另一个地球上的人
Seriously? You really are from another planet.

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,140
我们认为阻止奥创的唯一方法
We believe the only way to stop ultron

123
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,090
是将他身体和宝石分开
is to separate his body from the stones.

124
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,290
但这个奥创可能躲在多元宇宙的任何地方
But this Ultron could be hiding anywhere in the Multiverse?

125
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,130
-没错  -手下有一支机器人杀手军团
- Yes. - Behind an army of killer robots?

126
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,800
-恐怕是的  -并且配备了一整组宝石
- Afraid so. - And armed with a full set of stones?

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
-她说得有道理  -我没说过这会很容易
- She's got a point. - I never said it would be easy.

128
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,620
这根本是自杀任务
This is a suicide mission.

129
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,560
不好意思  问一下
Um, excuse me, yeah.

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,530
有没有哪个宇宙的中餐
Is there a universe of Chinese food

131
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,680
是有跨维外卖服务的
that has alternate dimension delivery?

132
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,370
我肚子饿得咕咕叫了
Tummy's getting rumbly.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,220
是你自己选的人
You picked them.

134
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,340
{\an8}吃得开心

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,430
显而易见  第一步应该是找到他
Well, obviously the first step would be finding him.

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,160
我是不喜欢自夸啦
Well, I'm not one to brag,

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,590
但听说我很擅长引来不必要的关注
but I've been told that I excel at attracting unwanted attention.

138
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,010
那一招会用得着
That will come in handy.

139
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,620
我们取回宝石后  就将其摧毁
And after we recover the stones, we destroy them.

140
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,070
你要怎么才能摧毁...
How would you even go about destroying the...

141
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,460
你是在回答我的问题  抱歉  谢谢
Oh, you're answering my question. Sorry. Thank you.

142
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,940
无限碎石机
The Infinity Crusher,

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,510
旨在将每颗宝石碎为乌有
designed to disintegrate each stone into nothing.

144
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,440
没错  我选的人
Yep. I picked them.

145
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,950
好了各位  你们都知道该做什么  都知道计划
All right, everyone, you all know what to do. You know the plan.

146
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,950
夺下灵魂宝石  交给卡魔拉
Get the Soul Stone and get it to Gamora.

147
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,950
我们守住防线  然后她会发动碎石机
We'll hold the line. And then she'll unleash the Crusher.

148
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,480
运气好的话  我们还能赶回家吃晚饭
With some luck, we'll be home for dinner.

149
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,000
等一下  说慢一点
Okay, wait. Slow down a little bit.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,520
在场还有一些人没听明白
There's a few people in the room that don't understand.

151
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,770
不是我  我明白了
Not me. I get it.

152
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,690
但是为了他们着想  还是重复一遍吧
But for them, maybe repeat it.

153
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,960
你们准备好了  朋友们  好戏开场了
You're ready. It's showtime, my friends.

154
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,850
祝你们好运
Good luck.

155
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,260
这个地方安全吗
This place is safe?

156
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,080
很明显  这里没有多少智慧生命
Apparently, there's not

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,890
能吸引奥创前来
enough intelligent life here to attract Ultron.

158
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,820
这正是我们来的目的
Until we decide to.

159
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,540
我能问问这是怎么回事吗
Can I ask, what happened?

160
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,240
和你的遭遇相同  亲爱的
Same thing that happened to you. Love.

161
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,450
我猜你认识你那个宇宙里的卡特队长吧
I take it you know the Captain Carter on your universe?

162
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,720
不  是美国队长
No. Captain America.

163
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,080
在我的宇宙  史蒂夫·罗杰斯注射了血清
In my universe, Steve Rogers received the serum.

164
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,450
我可真想看看那副场景
Now, that would be a sight to see.

165
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,020
你相信他吗
You trust him?

166
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,530
我相信所有人
I trust everyone.

167
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,060
来吧  朋友们  为了明日的战斗
Hasten, friends. Tonight we feast.

168
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,550
今晚我们不醉不归
For tomorrow, we fight.

169
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,020
既然如此  我提议我们干一杯
In that spirit, I propose a toast.

170
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,720
-蜂蜜酒  太棒了  -这就对了
- Some mead. Wonderful. - Ooh. Now we're talking.

171
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,850
一位睿智的法师曾告诉我
A wise sorcerer once told me

172
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,700
人终有一死
that to face death is part of the plan.

173
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,480
而面对死亡就是要克服对未知的极度恐惧
To face death is to conquer one's greatest fear of the unknown

174
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,890
对虚无的恐惧  对一切终结的恐惧
of nothingless space, of the end of all ends.

175
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
对于无意义的虚无  和无穷的无限
The senseless nothing and the vast opening of infinity to your...

176
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,170
让我来吧  你说得够多了  博士
Let me. You've done enough, Doctor.

177
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,700
敬多元宇宙
To the Guardians of...

178
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,940
守卫队
The Multiverse.

179
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
多元宇宙守卫队
The Multiverse!

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,130
原来这个宇宙还是有
So there is life in this universe,

181
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,990
生命的
after all.

182
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,890
还没准备好  就要开战了
There goes waiting until we're ready.

183
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,990
我得说  我警告过你们了
In my defense, I did warn you.

184
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,110
我擅长吸引不必要的注意
I excel at attracting unwanted attention.

185
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,980
好吧  我给大家加一个异态防护咒
All right, here comes a non-compliant spell.

186
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,140
可能感觉有点奇怪
Yeah, you might feel it.

187
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,340
这是什么情况
Oh, what is going on?

188
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,190
这是个保护咒  不用谢
It's a protection spell. You're welcome.

189
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,920
太棒了  开始吧  观察者
This is fantastic. Showtime. Watcher!

190
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,730
另一边见
See you on the flip side.

191
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,550
我知道怎么处理这个扫兴的人
I know how to deal with this party pooper.

192
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,910
等等  托尔  按计划行事
Wait! Thor, the plan.

193
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:44,400
拉斯维加斯万岁
Viva Las Vegas!

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,470
什么
What?

195
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,030
我以前好像没听过这样的口号
Can't say I've heard that battle cry before.

196
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,860
太简单了
All too easy.

197
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,020
有意思
Interesting.

198
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,390
通常来说  杀你们这些人轻而易举
Usually, you people are much easier to kill.

199
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,510
天啊  真是毫发无伤
Blimey! Not even a scratch.

200
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,270
你这个防护咒还真管用
You weren't kidding about a protection spell.

201
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,550
是很管用  但是坚持不了多久
You're protected, but it won't last long.

202
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,760
-该我们了  你有信心吗  -当然没有
- We're up. Are you sure about this? - Of course not.

203
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,170
走吧  快
Here we go. Now!

204
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,130
-抓住你了  -下来
- Gotcha. - Get off!

205
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,940
拿到了吗
Did you get it?

206
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,630
勇度说过  "永远不要怀疑小偷们"
As Yondu says, "Never doubt sticky fingers."

207
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,320
走  快走
Go! Go!

208
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,070
什么  原来你一直藏着这一手
What? You've been hiding that the entire time?

209
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,590
玩得很开心
Well, this has been delightful.

210
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,470
但我也该展示一下我的玩具了
But it's time for me to bring out some of my own toys.

211
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,270
我的宝石  你们偷了我的灵魂宝石
My stone. You stole my Soul Stone?

212
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,530
该走了
Time to go.

213
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,050
这下他可有的忙了
That'll keep him busy.

214
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,040
僵尸  好主意  我喜欢僵尸
Zombies! Great idea. I love zombies.

215
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,600
重点不是僵尸  是跟着僵尸来的人
It's not them. It's what came with the zombies.

216
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,450
伙计们  时间紧迫
Tick tock, boys.

217
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,450
这倒是没想到
That was unexpected.

218
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,810
什么
What?

219
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,370
我的老天啊
Blimey bloody bollocks!

220
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,090
你们成功了
Oh, you made it.

221
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,410
-准备好了吗  -宝石呢
- You ready? - The stone?

222
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,160
等等  不要  别开火
No, wait. Stand down.

223
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,190
-她是娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫  -谁
- She's Natasha Romanoff. - Who?

224
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,560
对  我也应该是这个星球上的最后一个人了
Yeah. I'm also supposed to be the last person on this planet.

225
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,730
我们来自另一个宇宙  多个宇宙
We're from another universe. Universes.

226
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,050
我们是来阻止奥创的
We're here to stop Ultron.

227
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,650
我能证明这一点
I can prove it.

228
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,490
你的父亲是伊凡  养父是阿列克谢
Your father is Ivan. Your da's Alexei.

229
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,100
你是唯一我信任到  为我殿后的女性  现在也是
And you're the one woman I trust to have my six, including now.

230
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,060
在这个宇宙里你只相信三个人
There are three people you trust in the universe,

231
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,900
而我很幸运地就是其中之一
and I count myself lucky enough to be one of them.

232
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,900
我们一定很亲密
Well, we must be close.

233
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,820
我觉得准确的词汇是"闺蜜"
I believe the term is "BFF."

234
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,670
我想你拿着属于我的一件东西
I believe that you have something that belongs to me.

235
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,950
娜塔莎
Natasha!

236
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,000
什么...
Wha...

237
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,240
我只需要动动意念就能消灭不同星系
I can destroy galaxies with a thought.

238
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,370
你们怎么还不死
Why won't you die?

239
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,950
等一下  怎么回事
Wait. What?

240
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,330
使出你浑身解数  不要给他思考的机会
Give him all you've got. Don't give him a chance to think.

241
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,580
拉斯维加斯
Vegas!

242
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,840
你完了
You're done.

243
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,500
就这样吗  结束了
Is that it? Is it over?

244
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,750
我们赢了  对吗  并不是很难
We win? Yeah? Not so hard.

245
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,310
我并不觉得结束了
It doesn't feel over.

246
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,630
我真的很惊讶
I'm honestly surprised.

247
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,580
观察者没警告过你们吗
Didn't the Watcher warn you?

248
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,090
每个宇宙都不同  每一个都碎片化的独特
Every universe is different, each one just a fraction unique.

249
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,680
而且无限宝石也是独特的
Thus the Infinity Stones are unique.

250
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,060
我明白了
Of course.

251
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,190
碎石机被设计成
The Crusher was designed

252
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,290
用来毁掉我空间的宝石  不是他那组
to destroy the stones on my world, not his.

253
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,040
大家做好战斗准备
Brace yourselves.

254
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,090
你  是你
You. It's you.

255
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,790
只要我毁灭了你  你们就都完了
If I destroy you, you all fall.

256
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,990
队长  我有个办法
Hey, Cap, I have an idea,

257
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,670
但我需要点距离并锁定目标  你能帮我吗
but I'll need distance and a clear target. Can you do that?

258
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,620
我有盾  你有刀
I've got the shield. You've got the sword.

259
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,500
更准确说是箭尖带着病毒之母的一支箭
More like an arrow with the mother of all viruses in the tip,

260
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,910
不过  俏皮话不错
but cute wordplay.

261
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,340
为了你  克林特
This one's for you, Clint.

262
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,840
这可比我的人体肉身好太多了
This is far nicer than my human body ever was.

263
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,440
谁在那  谁在说话
Who's there? Who said that?

264
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,050
这可是令人着迷的步调变化  对吗
This is a fascinating change of pace, yeah?

265
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,260
我已经好久都没有腿了
It has been a long time since I have had legs.

266
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,060
我想永久保持这个状态
I'd like to make this a permanent condition.

267
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,950
这个身体有人占了
This body is occupied.

268
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,710
暂时是  但持续不了多久了
For now, but not for long.

269
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,430
什么  你是谁  你的目的是什么
What? Who are you? What is your objective?

270
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,900
曾经的目标  是实现九头蛇的统治
Once upon a time, it was to bring forth HYDRA's domination,

271
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,740
但你终结了那个目标
but you ended that.

272
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,440
所以现在  我的目标就是终结你
So now, I suppose my objective is to end you.

273
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,690
这是什么
What is this?

274
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,370
你们都没事吧
Hey, are you all right?

275
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,280
我没事
I'm good.

276
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,920
好  刚才...麻烦有谁能解释一下吗
Okay, that was, uh... Can someone explain, please?

277
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,980
我给他植入了病毒  非常可怕的病毒
I gave him a virus. A nasty one.

278
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,710
堂哥  你在做什么
Cousin, what are you doing?

279
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,520
这是观察者欠我们的
The Watcher owes us this.

280
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,160
有了宝石  我们可以修复各自的宇宙
With these stones, we could fix our worlds

281
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,240
我们的命运
our lives.

282
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,410
特查拉  托尔
T'Challa, Thor,

283
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,620
你们要拒绝
are you gonna turn down

284
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,890
唯一能保证你们拯救自己宇宙的东西吗
the one thing guaranteed to save your homes?

285
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,980
佩吉  你可以和自己的爱人重聚
Peggy, you can be with your fella again.

286
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,770
斯特兰奇  你比任何人都清楚这就是答案
Strange, you more than anyone know that this is it.

287
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,920
这是我们唯一的机会
This is our only chance.

288
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,930
把宝石交出来  堂哥
Hand over the stones, cousin.

289
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,920
我不是你的堂哥
I'm not your cousin.

290
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,090
很抱歉今天要这么结束
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

291
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,920
不  不  不  我想那战甲是我的
Oh, no, no, no. I am afraid that armor belongs to me.

292
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,360
那是阿尼姆·佐拉吗
Is that Arnim Zola?

293
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,060
九头蛇从不会死  它只是变异了
HYDRA never died, it just mutated.

294
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,550
难怪脸长肚皮上
Well, that explains the stomach-face.

295
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,060
我们本来不是为了赢下战斗而来
We were never meant to win.

296
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,100
我们的目的是把宝石和身体分开
We were here to separate the stones from the body.

297
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,350
你遇预见了一切
You foresaw every moment

298
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,330
从无限碎石机的失败
from the failed Infinity Crusher,

299
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,570
到杀人魔头的背叛还有我的...
to Killmonger's betrayal, and my...

300
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,020
你的牺牲
Your sacrifice.

301
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,160
"牺牲"
"Sacrifice"?

302
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,310
这词得用在我还有什么可以失去的情况下
That would imply I had something to lose.

303
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,750
得有人盯着他们
Someone needs to attend to them.

304
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,180
如果那个袖珍宇宙维度碎了  他们逃出来...
If that pocket dimension cracks, if they escape--

305
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,520
我来看着
I'll watch.

306
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,720
我只剩大把的时间了
I have nothing but time.

307
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,080
谢谢你  斯蒂芬
Thank you, Stephen.

308
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,670
另外  朋友不就是用来做这种事的吗
Mmm. And besides, what are friends for?

309
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,180
整个多元宇宙都欠你们一句感谢
The entire Multiverse owes you a debt of gratitude.

310
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,130
但是你自己的世界永远不会知道这次胜利
But your worlds will never know this victory.

311
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,410
一旦你走过那扇门
Once you walk through that door,

312
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,980
会回到离开前的那一刻
you'll return to the exact moment you left.

313
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,660
是时候离开了  队长
It's time to go, Captain.

314
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,160
你想要回到另一条时间线上
You'd rather return to another time.

315
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,570
难道我还没赢得自己的幸福结局吗
Haven't I earned my happy ending?

316
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,490
相信我  这个宇宙在那个时刻
Trust me, that world, that time,

317
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,550
需要卡特队长
needs Captain Carter.

318
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,260
现在只剩下你了
And then there was one.

319
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,110
我不会回去了  我的世界已经...
I won't go back there. My world is...

320
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,510
不在了
gone.

321
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,800
你赢了  但是我输了
You won, but I lost.

322
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,700
-我不能干...  -干预  是的  我知道
- I cannot in-- - Interfere? Yeah, I know.

323
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,520
我们对你来说只是故事  不是真实的
We're just stories to you. We're not real.

324
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,950
你看着我们战斗  胜利  失败
You watch us fight, win, lose.

325
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,740
告诉我  奥创杀我的朋友  把我的世界夷为平地时
Tell me, did you make popcorn while Ultron murdered my friends

326
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,620
你是不是还准备了爆米花
and burned my world to the ground?

327
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,720
你们对我来说不止如此
You are more than that to me.

328
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,700
是吗
Are we?

329
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,890
你  你的故事
You, your stories,

330
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,200
他们是我的一切
they are everything to me.

331
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,200
那就拯救我的世界
Then fix my world.

332
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,200
我不能  娜塔莎
I can't, Natasha.

333
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,380
我不会走过那扇门的
I'm not walking through that door.

334
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,900
那扇门也只是做做样子而已
Well, the door was more of a metaphor anyway.

335
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,760
我们...   我们在哪里
Where... Where are we?

336
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,200
在一个刚刚失去了黑寡妇的世界
On a world that lost their Widow.

337
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,610
真是一团糟
It's a mess.

338
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,410
谢谢
Thank you.

339
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,850
你和你的复仇者代替品们已经英勇地战斗过了
You and your replacement Avengers fought valiantly,

340
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,910
现在是时候告诉我所有的秘密了
but now I think it's time you told me all your secrets.

341
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,280
他们跟我说你死了
I was told you were dead.

342
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,430
你也一样
Same.

343
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,370
你不是我的娜塔莎
You're not my Natasha,

344
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,420
但是我感觉你有她的精神
but something tells me you have her spirit.

345
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,270
这就够了  不是吗
That's it, isn't it?

346
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,010
世间万物都在寻找自己的归属
All creatures searching for a place to belong.

347
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,330
自己的家
To call home.

348
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,430
至于我  观察者
As for me, I am the Watcher.

349
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,880
整个多元宇宙  每一个世界  每一个故事都是我的家园
The Multiverse, every single world, every story is my home,

350
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,140
我会永远保护他们
and I will protect it to the end.

351
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,190
我超快的
I'm too fast.

352
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,980
别告诉我他是你喜欢的类型
Don't tell me, he was your type?

353
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,940
寡妇  我看见你太高兴了
Oh, Widow, I've never been so happy to see you.

354
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,980
你这是撞到头了还是怎么的
Did you hit your head or something?

355
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,970
还真撞了几次
A few times, actually.

356
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,730
赶快缓过来  你需要其中精力对付这个
Shake it off. You'll need all your marbles for this one.

357
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,400
我发现海盗的目标是什么了
I found what the pirates were after.

358
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,370
佩吉  你需要有心理准备
Peggy, you might wanna brace yourself.

359
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,550
我向你保证  小娜
I can promise you, Nat,

360
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,330
这肯定不是我今天见过的最奇怪的事情
this won't be the strangest thing I've dealt with today.

361
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,410
这话听着耳熟
Famous last words.

362
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,980
九头蛇践踏者
The HYDRA Stomper?

363
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,730
是啊  里面有人
Yeah, and there's someone inside.
